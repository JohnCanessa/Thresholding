# Thresholding
Experiment with thresholds on an image

In this code we experiment with thresholds on an image
using sciket-image. The edited code came from a PluralSight
course by Janani Ravi.

If interested in additional comments, I invite you to 
read the following post in my blog:

Keep in mind, that one of the best ways to learn is
to read, experiment, and repeat as needed.

Enjoy,

John
